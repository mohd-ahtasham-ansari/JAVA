# ✨ Java Practice

Hi! I'm **Mohd Ahtasham Ansari**, and this repository is the starting point of my **Data Structures and Algorithms** journey with **Java**.

Right now, I'm building my foundation by practicing **pattern printing** problems—one of the best ways to improve logic and understand nested loops in programming.

## 📌 What's Inside?

This repository currently contains:

- ⭐ Basic pattern printing programs
- 🧠 Focus on logic building with nested loops
- 📄 Well-commented Java code for each pattern
- 📁 Organized by pattern type (e.g., triangles, pyramids, diamonds, etc.)

## ✅ Patterns Covered

-[X] STAR PATTERN  (easy 16-april-25)
-[X] NUMBER PATTERN (easy 16-april-25)
> 📍 I'll keep adding more patterns as I practice daily.

## 🚀 Why Pattern Printing?

Pattern problems:
- Help build strong logic and loop control
- Are often asked in coding interviews (beginner rounds)
- Make you confident with conditionals, loops, and basic syntax

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language**: Java
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

## 🌱 About Me

I'm a B.Tech student in AI & ML at **GL Bajaj Institute of Technology & Management**.  
This repository is a small but important step in my journey to master **DSA**, crack coding interviews, and become a strong software developer.
